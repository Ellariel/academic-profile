My research interests lie in sustainable development at both the technological and social levels. As a social scientist, I study pro-environmental behavior and its determinants, as well as economic models in emerging environmental cultures. As a computer scientist, I investigate green computing and the role of artificial intelligence in promoting sustainable development and mitigating climate change.

If you have interesting ideas or projects that require scientific expertise or quantitative research skills, please contact me.

Skills:
  - Quantitative research, Econometrics
  - Python, R
